- ✅ **Report both good and bad** - We want to know what works too!

### **What to Look For**
- **Does it work as expected?**
- **Is it fast enough?**

## 💡 **Pro Tips for Better Testing**

1. **Think like a user** - What would frustrate you?
2. **Try edge cases** - What if someone enters their name as "🤖 Robot"?
3. **Test complete flows** - Login → Do something → Logout
4. **Note your environment** - Browser, device, internet speed
5. **Be specific with steps** - Number them clearly
6. **Report positives too** - "The homepage animation is really smooth!"
