1. **Access the Google Sheet**: [Insert link here]
2. **Check Lookup Sheet**: Verify your group exists and is ready for tester assignments
3. **Review Issue Tracker**: Familiarize yourself with the column structure
4. **Test Data Entry**: Add a sample issue to ensure you can edit the sheet

### **Feature Knowledge**
1. **Review your group's features**: Understand what should be tested
2. **Know common issues**: Think about what could break in your area
3. **Prepare test scenarios**: Have 2-3 specific test cases ready

## ⏰ **During the Event**

### **0:05-0:10 - Group Assignment Phase**
- **Welcome your testers**: Introduce yourself and explain your group's focus
- **Help with assignments**: Guide testers to add their names to your group in the lookup sheet
- **Balance groups**: If your group gets too full, suggest alternatives

### **0:15-0:45 - Testing Phase (30 minutes)**

#### **Your Responsibilities**
1. **Guide Testing**: Help testers understand what to test in your area
2. **Answer Questions**: Provide clarification on features and expected behavior
3. **Validate Issues**: Review tester findings for accuracy and completeness
4. **Categorize Criticality**: Help determine if issues are Critical/High/Medium/Low
5. **Encourage Thorough Testing**: Suggest edge cases and different scenarios
6. **Monitor Progress**: Keep track of what's been tested vs. remaining

#### **Issue Validation Checklist**
For each issue reported, ensure:
- ✅ **Clear Description**: What exactly is broken/working
- ✅ **Steps to Reproduce**: Specific steps to follow
- ✅ **Expected vs. Actual**: What's supposed to happen vs. what does happen
- ✅ **Severity Level**: Critical (blocks core functionality), High (major issue), Medium (annoying), Low (cosmetic)
- ✅ **Device/Browser Info**: Where the issue occurs

#### **Helpful Questions to Ask Testers**
- "Can you show me exactly what you're seeing?"
- "What steps did you take right before this happened?"
- "Does this happen on different browsers/devices?"
- "Is this preventing you from completing the main task?"

### **0:45-1:00 - Reporting Phase (15 minutes)**

#### **Consolidation Process**
1. **Review all issues**: Scan your group's entries in the spreadsheet
2. **Categorize by severity**: Count Critical/High/Medium/Low issues
3. **Assess completion**: Estimate what percentage of features were tested
4. **Identify patterns**: Note any common issues or themes

#### **Your 2-Minute Report**
Structure your report as:
- **Completion %**: "We tested approximately X% of the features"
- **Bug Summary**: "Found X critical, Y high, Z medium, W low priority issues"
- **Key Findings**: "Main issues were... / Features working well include..."

## 📊 **Criticality Guidelines**

### **Critical (🚨 Blocks Core Functionality)**
- Cannot access the main feature at all
- Security vulnerabilities
- Payment processing failures
- Complete system crashes
- Data loss or corruption

### **High (⚠️ Major Impact)**
- Core features not working as expected
- Authentication failures
- Chat responses not loading
- Payment flow interruptions
- Admin functions unavailable

### **Medium (📝 Annoying but Workable)**
- UI inconsistencies
- Slow performance
- Minor navigation issues
- Cosmetic problems
- Edge case failures

### **Low (💅 Cosmetic/Enhancement)**
- Minor styling issues
- Small text problems
- Non-critical feature gaps
- Nice-to-have improvements

## 🛠 **Technical Support**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**
- **Spreadsheet access problems**: Have testers refresh the page or try incognito mode
- **Website loading issues**: Check if it's a general problem or device-specific
- **Test account issues**: Use provided credentials or create new ones
- **Mobile testing**: Encourage use of browser dev tools for mobile simulation

### **Escalation Path**
1. **Try to resolve locally first**: Most issues can be handled within your group
2. **Contact coordinator**: For technical problems or process questions
3. **Document workarounds**: If issues can't be resolved, note them and continue testing
