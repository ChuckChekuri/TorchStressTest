## ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas Needing Improvement

### 1. **TypeScript Strictness** (Medium Priority)
```typescript
// tsconfig.json
{
  "strict": false,        // Should be true
  "strictNullChecks": true // Good, but inconsistent with strict: false
}
```
**Recommendation**: Enable full strict mode for better type safety.

### 2. **ESLint Configuration Warning** (Low Priority)
- Warning about module type in `eslint.config.js`
- **Fix**: Add `"type": "module"` to `package.json`

### 3. **Test Coverage** (Medium Priority)
- Unit tests exist but coverage could be expanded
- Missing integration tests for critical user flows
- **Recommendation**: Add more comprehensive testing for AI chat flows and payment processing

### 4. **Error Boundary Coverage** (Low Priority)
- Good error boundaries in place, but could be more comprehensive
- **Recommendation**: Add error boundaries around more component trees

### 5. **Code Comments** (Low Priority)
- Some complex logic lacks inline documentation
- **Recommendation**: Add JSDoc comments for complex business logic
