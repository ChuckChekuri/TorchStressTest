## üì¶ Dependencies

### External Libraries
- **37 production dependencies** - Libraries required for the website to run
- **28 development dependencies** - Tools used during development (testing, building)

**What this means**: The project uses 37 external libraries to function (like AWS services, React, payment processing). This is a moderate number - not too many (which could slow things down) and not too few (which would require writing everything from scratch).

**Key Dependencies Include**:
- AWS Amplify (backend services)
- React 19 (user interface)
- Next.js 15 (web framework)
- Stripe (payment processing)
- Framer Motion (animations)

## ‚ö° Backend Infrastructure

### AWS Lambda Functions
- **3 Lambda functions** - Serverless backend functions

**Functions**:
1. Chat function (AI conversation handling)
2. Email function (contact form processing)
3. Payment function (order processing)

**What this means**: The backend uses serverless architecture, meaning it only runs when needed and scales automatically. This reduces costs and improves reliability.

### API Routes
- **4 API routes** - Server-side endpoints for data operations

**What this means**: The website has 4 server-side endpoints that handle things like fetching data, processing forms, and managing authentication.

---

## üß™ Testing & Quality

### Test Coverage
- **1 test file** - Automated tests to verify code works correctly

**What this means**: The project has minimal automated testing currently. This is an area for improvement to ensure code quality and prevent bugs.

---

## üìú Scripts & Automation

### Utility Scripts
- **10 script files** - Automation scripts for deployment, testing, and data management

**Key Scripts**:
- `seed-chat-interactions.sh` - Pre-populate common Q&A (cost optimization)
- `delete-all-interactions.ts` - Database cleanup
- `process-saved-prompts.ts` - Batch process chat questions
- `reclassify-topics.ts` - Update chat topic classifications
- `query-chat-interactions.ts` - Database queries

**What this means**: The project has good automation for common tasks like seeding data, cleaning databases, and managing deployments.
