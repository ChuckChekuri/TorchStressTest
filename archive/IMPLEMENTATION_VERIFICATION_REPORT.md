## 🤔 **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED FEATURES**

### **Admin Dashboard**
- Basic functionality exists but lacks advanced features
- Order and blog management work, but no analytics or bulk operations

### **Email Systems**
- Stripe sends payment receipts automatically
- Contact form submissions work
- But custom email confirmations for orders are not implemented

---

## 📊 **CORRECTIONS MADE TO TESTING PLAN**

### **Group Adjustments**
- **Group 1**: Changed from "6 scenes" to "5 scenes"
- **Group 2**: Removed password reset testing
- **Group 3**: Removed topic classification and prompt carousel testing
- **Group 5**: Removed email confirmation testing
- **Group 6**: Adjusted expectations for limited analytics

### **Tester Count Reduction**
- **Original**: 74 testers
- **Corrected**: 64 testers (removed 10 testers from unimplemented features)

### **Testing Scope Reduction**
- Removed testing for password reset flows
- Removed testing for topic classification features
- Removed testing for email confirmation systems
- Removed testing for advanced admin analytics
- Removed testing for Jest/Cypress frameworks

---

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDED TESTING APPROACH**

### **Focus on Implemented Features**
1. **Homepage**: Test the actual 5 scenes thoroughly
2. **Authentication**: Test signup/login/role access (skip password reset)
3. **Chat**: Test conversation flow and persistence (skip topic classification)
4. **Blog**: Test full commenting and admin workflow
5. **Payment**: Test complete order flow (skip email confirmations)
6. **Admin**: Test order/blog/user management (expect basic functionality)

### **Adjusted Success Criteria**
- ✅ All core user journeys work end-to-end
- ✅ Authentication and authorization function properly
- ✅ Payment processing completes successfully
- ✅ Admin functions are operational
- ✅ Mobile experience is responsive
- ✅ Chat system responds appropriately

### **Removed Success Criteria**
- ❌ Password reset functionality
- ❌ Email confirmations
- ❌ Topic classification accuracy
- ❌ Advanced admin analytics
- ❌ Unit test coverage
- ❌ E2E test automation

## 📈 **IMPACT ON TESTING**

### **Positive Impacts**
- More focused testing on actually implemented features
- Higher quality feedback on working functionality
- Realistic expectations for feature completeness
- Better resource allocation (64 vs 74 testers)

### **Risk Mitigation**
- Avoid testing non-existent features that would create false failures
- Focus tester effort on validating working code
- Prevent confusion about expected vs actual functionality

## 🔧 **DEVELOPMENT RECOMMENDATIONS**

Based on this verification, consider implementing these missing features before launch:

1. **Password Reset**: High priority for user experience
2. **Email Confirmations**: Essential for order fulfillment
3. **Topic Classification**: Valuable for chat analytics
4. **Admin Analytics**: Important for business insights
5. **Testing Framework**: Jest/Cypress for quality assurance
